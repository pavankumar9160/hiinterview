User Management Design -

    Define clear roles:

    Admin

    Mentor

    Buddy

    Candidate

    Hybrid roles (e.g., Buddy + Mentor).

Sign-Up & Data Collection-

Design sign-up forms tailored to role type (Candidate, Mentor, etc.).

Collect essential information (e.g., name, email, phone, skills, experience, preferences, etc.).

Authentication & Login

Implement secure authentication (email/password, OAuth, etc.).

Once logged in, fetch user details from the database.


Dashboard / Profile Page :

Show role-specific details on Dashboard or My Profile page.

Example: Candidate sees their skills & assigned mentor; Mentor sees assigned candidates.

Admin Role

Admin creates connections:

Candidate ↔ Buddy

Candidate ↔ Mentor

Manage assignments and relationships.

Chat Feature

Enable communication between connected users (Candidate–Buddy, Candidate–Mentor).

Ensure role-based permissions for chat.

Payment (Future Scope)

Payment system will be handled later (not part of current phase).
